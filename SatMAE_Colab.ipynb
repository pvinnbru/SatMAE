    "\n",
    "This notebook uses a **minimal conda environment** optimized specifically for SatMAE finetuning tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Key Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Exact package versions**: PyTorch 1.11.0, timm 0.3.2, NumPy 1.21.2 - exactly as SatMAE authors tested\n",
    "- **Faster installation**: ~20 packages (vs ~200 in full env) = 2-5 minutes vs 10-15 minutes\n",
    "- **Smaller footprint**: ~1.5GB disk usage vs ~4GB for full environment\n",
    "- **Zero compatibility issues**: No NumPy 2.0 conflicts, no torch._six errors, no version patching needed\n",
    "- **Finetuning-focused**: Only includes packages needed for training, not data preprocessing or development\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 **Minimal Package Set:**\n",
    "- **Core**: PyTorch 1.11.0 + CUDA 11.3, timm 0.3.2, NumPy 1.21.2\n",
    "- **Data**: rasterio, pandas, pillow (for EuroSAT dataset)\n",
    "- **Training**: tqdm, tensorboard\n",
    "- **Optional**: wandb (for experiment tracking)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **Perfect for:**\n",
    "- ✅ Model finetuning (our use case)\n",
    "- ✅ Inference/evaluation\n",
    "- ✅ Quick experiments\n",
    "- ❌ Not for: Data preprocessing, model pretraining, or development work\n",
